# SCF-QUBO-results

Repository containing results for [insert doi] and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04223)

The raw data can be found in `data` and the jupyter notebooks in `analysis` generate all the plots in the paper. They also detail how other information can be accessed if required.

To re-run the analysis please first run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all the requirements. The unzipped data is also required, therefore please run in the root dir:
```
python uncompress.py
```

The jupyter notebooks should now be able to be run.
